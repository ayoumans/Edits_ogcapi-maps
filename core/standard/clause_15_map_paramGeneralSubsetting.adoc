== Requirement Class "General Subsetting"

=== Overview

[[maps-general-subsetting-overview]]

include::requirements/requirements_class_general_subsetting.adoc[]

This requirements class defines the way a subset of the map resource in additional dimensions beyond spatial and temporal can be specified using the `subset` parameter.
This functionality is defined as common building blocks shared with other OGC APIs.

=== Describing the extent of the additional dimensions

When implementing this requirements class, additional dimensions included in an extent description (e.g., as found in a OGC API collection description response)
must use a uniform approach to describe the lower and upper bounds of those dimensions based on the `intervals` property, just as with the temporal dimension.

include::requirements/general-subsetting/REQ_uniform-additional-dimensions.adoc[]

=== `subset-crs` query parameter

include::requirements/general-subsetting/REQ_subset-crs-definition.adoc[]

=== `subset` query parameter

The implementation must support all additional dimensions listed in the extent as valid dimensions to be used with the `subset` parameter.

=== Response
A successful GET response is described in the core class (http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-maps-1/1.0/conf/core).

=== Error conditions

A general summary of the HTTP status codes can be found in http://www.opengis.net/doc/IS/ogcapi-features-1/1.0[OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core, version 1.0] as well as in OGC API - Common.

If the parameter value for the additional dimensions is not compatible with what the collections can offer, the status code of the response will be `404`.
