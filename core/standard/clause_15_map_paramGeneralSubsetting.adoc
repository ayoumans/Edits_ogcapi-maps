[[maps-general-subsetting-overview]]

include::requirements/requirements_class_general_subsetting.adoc[]

This requirements class defines the way date and time can be used as a parameter to filter the content in the map resource. This conformance class is importing most of the functionality from OGC API - Commons.

=== Describing the extent of the additional dimensions

=== `subset=` query parameter request and response

=== Response
A successful GET response is described in the core class (http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-maps-1/1.0/conf/core).

=== Error conditions

A general summary of the HTTP status codes can be found in http://www.opengis.net/doc/IS/ogcapi-features-1/1.0[OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core, version 1.0] as well as in OGC API - Common.

If the parameter value for the additional dimensions is not compatible with what the collections can offer, the status code of the response will be `404`.
