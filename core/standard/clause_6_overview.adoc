=== Introduction

The _OGC API - Maps_ Standard defines building blocks which can be used in a Web API implementation to retrieve geospatial data as maps that are visual
portrayals of the data created by applying a style to the data (see <<rc_core>>).
Maps can present the whole area of the geospatial data or a subset of the content, such as by filtering the data by extent (see <<rc_spatial-subsetting>>).
Maps can be retrieved by arbitrary extent or as tiles (see <<rc_tilesets>>).

The core conformance class is the only mandatory one. All other conformance classes are optional and depend on the _core_.

An annex with examples of map requests and responses is included as a way to learn by examples how this standard can be applied. See <<annex_examples>>.

An example OpenAPI definition for this standard is available at:
https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-maps/master/openapi/ogcapi-maps-1.bundled.json .

The modular and reusable components used in this example OpenAPI definition can be found http://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/maps/part1/1.0/openapi .
More details on how to adjust and bundle these components can be found in <<rc_oas30>>.

NOTE: While this specification is in draft status, the components are available from https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-maps/tree/master/openapi .


Services and clients are encouraged to support as many of the Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)s as possible for all geospatial data resources to maximize
interoperability. However, this Standard does not require support for any specific CRS.

The _OGC API - Maps_ Standard does not specify any requirement for the type of _geospatial data resource_ that could be delivered as maps.
If the geospatial data resources can be organized into maps, they can be supported regardless of whether they are feature data, coverages, a resource that does not represent data per se (e.g., an annotation) and so forth.

NOTE: Geospatial data resources (e.g., collections) replace the concept of layer in WMS and WMTS.
The main difference is that layers in WMS and WMTS were not defined by other OGC APIs and did not support other functionalities.

These geospatial data resources can advertise one or more map portrayals in several resources, such as the dataset (see <<rc_dataset-map>>), a collection (see <<rc_collection-map>>), a dataset with a style, or a collection with a style (see <<rc_styled-map>>).
Other OGC APIs can provide other origins that may be represented as maps.

Accessing the _geospatial data resource_ content (other than as maps) or its descriptions is possible but out of the scope of this standard.
If a description of the _geospatial data resource_ is specified by another standard, and this description has a mechanism to add links to other resources, this standard indicates the need to add a link to the list of available maps.

The _OGC API - Maps_ Standard does not specify how to get a Web API definition, the conformance class list or the collections lists.
However, the standard assumes that the first two are defined by an OGC API standard (e.g., _OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core_) and the latter by an
OGC API for collections (e.g., _OGC API - Common - Part 2: Geospatial data_). A similar definition is provided directly by _OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core_.

This document is the first part of a series of _OGC API - Maps_ "parts" that follows the core and extensions model.
Future parts will specify other extensions, such as how to specify cartographic layout elements to be included on the map,
how to specify a filter for which elements should be included on the map, and possibly how to query information for a point in a map.

=== Map interoperability

One of the most significant use cases of the _Maps API_ is the ability to generate maps on the web that can be combined into a single view.
This standard provides a clear and common way to request a map image that covers a bounding box of interest with a defined number of pixel rows and columns.
When the _Maps API_ is implemented by different organizations that offer different collections of information, the same bounding box, in the same CRS and the same number
of rows and columns can be requested from each organization's geospatial repository.
The result is a set of images that perfectly overlap showing different variables of the same area depending on the collection of geospatial data requested.
For example, a population map can be requested to one organization (e.g., SEDAC Population Density) and weather forecast to another
(e.g., NDFD Surface Wind Velocity) in the exact same way allowing to present both together in one overlaid view or side by side.

=== How to approach an OGC API
There are at least two ways to approach an OGC API.

* Read the landing page, look for links, follow them and discover new links until the desired resource is found
* Read a Web API definition document that specifies a list of paths and path templates to resources.

For the first approach, many resources in a deployed Web API include links with _rel_ properties to document the reason and purpose for this relation. The following figure illustrates the resources as ellipses and the links as arrows with the link _rel_ as a label.

[#img_relMapTiles,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']
.Resources and relations to them via links
image::images/relMapTiles.png[width=600,align="center"]

For the second approach, implementations should consider the <<rc_oas30>> which defines the use of _operationID_ suffixes, providing a mechanism to associate API paths with the requirements class that they implement.

There is a third way to approach an OGC API implementation instance that relies on assuming a set of predefined paths and path templates.
These predefined paths are used in many examples in this document and are presented together in <<table_resources>>.
It is expected that many implementations of the Maps API Standard will provide a Web API definition document (e.g., OpenAPI) using this set of predefined paths and path templates to get necessary resources directly.
All this could mislead the reader into getting the false impression that the predefined paths are enforced.
Therefore, building a client that is assuming a predefined set of paths is risky.
However, it is expected that many API implementations follow the predefined set of paths. The clients using this assumption could be successful in many occasions.
Again, be aware that these paths are not required by the Maps API Standard.

NOTE: Even though full path and full path templates in the previous table may be used in many implementations of the _OGC API - Maps_ standard, these exact paths are ONLY examples and are NOT required by this Standard. Other paths are possible if correctly described in by the Web API definition document and/or the links between resources.


=== What a map is, and its relation to other OGC Web APIs

A map is a portrayal of data resulting from applying a style (usually 2D image formats such as PNG or JPEG format or in presentation formats such as SVG). The way the styling rules in a style are applied to the data to create the portrayal is out of scope of this standard (see https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-styles[_OGC API - Styles_], as well as specific styles and symbology standards such as https://github.com/opengeospatial/styles-and-symbology[OGC Styles & Symbology], for details).
A map can be delivered as a single resource or as an arbitrary extent.
In addition, a map can also be delivered as tiles by combining the OGC API - Maps with some _OGC API - Tiles_ requirements classes. This approach is defined by the _Map Tilesets_ requirements class of this standard,
which also correspond to _map tilesets_ described in _OGC API - Tiles_, with a _map_ being a specific type of data resource for which tiles are provided.

This Standard defines building blocks that can be combined with other APIs generating or providing access to information having a geospatial component,
including the other standards of the OGC API family such as _OGC API - Tiles_ and _OGC API - Processes_. The Maps API Standard can be referenced by other standards providing resources that can be offered as maps. For example:

* _OGC API - Tiles_ specifies the link relation types to access map tilesets from a dataset or collection.
* _OGC API - Styles_ defines paths to list available styles from which maps can also be accessed.
* _OGC API - Processes - Part 3: Workflows and Chaining_ provides a mechanism to trigger localized processing workflows as a result of retrieving maps (for a specific area and resolution of interest).

But possibilities are endless: for example, a generic open data API giving access to tables, some of them with columns storing latitude and longitude, could be enhanced with OGC APIs to provide mapping capabilities.

==== Dynamic and scalable map viewers

In the OGC, the concept of a map as an image was formulated in 1998 as part of the OGC Web Map Service standards work. At that time, the web was very young, most HTML pages were static, and JavaScript was a rudimentary programming language capable of controlling user entries in an HTML form and not much more. In that environment, having a service capable of creating a PNG that could be embedded as a HTML page by using an IMG tag provided the first approach to static maps on the web.  Replacing the source (SRC) of the IMG tag programmatically with JavaScript, as a reaction of some user actions, provided the first approach to dynamic maps. _GetFeatureInfo_ added a limited capability for queryable maps. However, users are now used to moving around the map by frequently doing zoom and pan operations. If the server does not provide a very fast response, the user experience is not fluid and the map display application is perceived as not responsive enough. One possible approach to solve this problem is to divide the viewport into tiles and request them separately. Since tiles follow a tile matrix pattern, they can be pre-rendered in the server or cached in the Internet. For implementing fast dynamic maps, the OGC API - Maps requirement should be combined with _OGC API - Tiles_ requirements.

==== Client side maps versus server side maps

The OGC API - Maps Standard deals with maps that are generated by the server. The client can present them with no modification. Currently, even the smallest rendering device supports hardware rendering i.e., the transformation from geometries to pixels can be done by the GPU. Transmitting geometries from the server commonly requires less bandwidth than transmitting the rendered map from the server and offers more flexibility in the client side to personalize the portrayal style. Because of this, it is expected that _OGC API - Maps_ use cases will focus more on static maps, infrequently changing requests for dynamic maps, as well as print cartography, whereas requesting raw data values using _OGC API - Tiles_ (e.g., Vector and Coverage Tiles) will be better suited for interactive clients presenting dynamic maps.

==== Description of the domain

The Maps API Standard defines how to describe the domain of the maps, including spatiotemporal axes as well as additional dimensions.

With the <<rc_collection-map,_Collection Map_>> requirements class, the collection description inherited from _OGC API - Common - Part 2_ contains an `extent` property that can
describe both the spatial and temporal domain of the data. In addition, the _Unified Additional Dimensions_ common building block, specified in the <<rc_general-subsetting,_General Subsetting_>> requirements class and used in the
example OpenAPI definition, requires that additional dimensions be described in a similar way to the temporal dimension.
An extra `grid` property also supports the specification of the resolution and the number of cells (for data organized as a regular grid) or
a list of coordinates (for data organized as an irregular grid) along each dimension.

The collection metadata allows the specification of a spatial bounding box for entire maps, as well as for each individual
collection of geospatial data represented or contained within the map (the _layers_). The resolution of these layers can also be specified by including
the minimum and maximum cell size and equivalent scale denominators.

==== Subsetting the domain and scaling

The Maps API Standard core class provides a way to retrieve the map that is modified by other classes allowing for subsetting and scale the map. These classes (<<rc_scaling, Scaling>>, <<rc_display-resolution, Display resolution>> and <<rc_spatial-subsetting, subsetting>>) define the following parameters:

[#table_params_scaling_subsetting,reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']
.Parameters for scaling and subsetting
[cols="33,66",options="header"]
!===
| Parameter | Definition
| `width` | Width of the viewport in pixel units
| `height` | Height of the viewport in pixel units
| `scale-denominator` | Number of units in the reality that is equivalent of 1 unit in the rendering device
| `mm-per-pixel` | Size of one pixel in the rendering device expressed in millimeters. The default value is 0.28mm
| `bbox` (`bbox-crs`) (and the equivalent `subset` and `subset-crs`) | Bounding box of the requested map in CRS coordinates. It defines the geographic size.
| `center` (`center-crs`) | Center of the requested map in CRS coordinates. `center` and `bbox` are mutually exclusive.
!===

All these parameters are optional. The server need to know the geographic size of the map in the reality, and the size of the map in the viewport. Some combinations completely defined both sizes. Some combinations of parameters generate impossible situations and will result in an error. Other combinations require that the server decides a default value for some not provided parameters to be able to resolve the requested sizes. This standard only specify the default value for `mm-per-pixel` leaving to the server freedom to decide about the others. The following table presents an overview of the different combinations.

==== Available formats and map response expectations

The Maps API Standard defines five requirements classes for specific encodings to encode map data.
Additional encodings can be supported using HTTP content negotiation, following conventions specific to those encodings.
