^|A |If "image/png" and "image/jpeg" are supported at an endpoint and both are present in the HTTP "Accept" request header with the same `q` value, and no other supported output format is present with a higher `q` value, the server SHOULD select between PNG and JPEG and return the format considered optimal (typically PNG if there's transparency or for categorical maps where a limited number of colors is used, and JPEG otherwise).
