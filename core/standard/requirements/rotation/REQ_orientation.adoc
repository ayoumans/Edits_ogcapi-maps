^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/rotation/orientation*
^|A |The implementation SHALL support an `orientation` parameter allowing to rotate the map by an orientation, expressed as clockwise degrees.
^|B |If an `orientation` parameter is not specified, the implementation SHALL assume a zero orientation value.
^|C |The orientation SHALL be applied to the map with the center of the selected spatial subset as the pivot point, or the center of the map if none is specified.
^|D |If an `orientation` parameter is used together with `subset` or `bbox` spatial subsetting parameter,
the orientation SHALL also be applied to the clipping box associated to that subset,
as if the equivalent `center`, `width` and `height` spatial subsetting query parameters were used instead.
This avoids leaving empty corners in the final rotated map image.
