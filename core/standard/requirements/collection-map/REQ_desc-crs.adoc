^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/geodata/desc-crs*
^|A |The `crs` property in the collection object of a geospatial collection SHALL contain URI or safe CURIEs for the list of CRSs supported by the server for that collection.
^|B |If the collection is available more efficiently (e.g., if it is stored in the server in that CRS) using a particular CRS (the native CRS, also _called storage CRS_) that is not http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84, a `storageCrs` property in the collection object of a geospatial collection SHALL be the URI or the safe CURIE for that CRS.
^|C |If a `storageCrs` property is used and that is not http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84, an extent SHALL be provided in a `storageCrsExtent` property following the same schema as the extent property.
|===

NOTE: A CURIE `{authority}[-{objectType}]:{id}` would map to the following OGC URI: `http://www.opengis.net/def/{objectType}/{authority}/0/{id}`. If `-{objectType}` is missing, the default object type is _crs_.
