^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/datetime/subset-definition*
^|A |The `subset` parameter SHALL have the following characteristics (using an Augmented Backus Naur Form (ABNF) fragment):

[source,ABNF]
----
  SubsetSpec:       "subset"=axisName(intervalOrPoint)
  axisName:         {text}
  intervalOrPoint:  interval \| point
  interval:         low : high
  low:              point \| *
  high:             point \| *
  point:            {number} \| "{text}"

  Where:
     \" = double quote = ASCII code 0x42,
     {number} is an integer or floating-point number, and
     {text} is some general ASCII text (such as a time and date notation in ISO 8601).
----
^|B |The implementation SHALL support `datetime` as an axis name, which is to be interpreted as the main temporal axis in the subsetting CRS definition.
^|C |The axis name SHALL correspond to one of the axis of the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) of the subsetting CRS or else return a 400 status code.
^|D |If the intervalOrPoint values fall entirely outside the range of valid values defined for the identified axis, a 204 status code SHALL be returned
^|E |For a CRS where an axis can wrap around, such as subsetting across the dateline (anti-meridian) in a geographic CRS, a `low` value greater than `high` SHALL
be supported to indicate an extent crossing that wrapping point.
^|F |The implementation SHALL interpret the coordinates as values for the named axis of the CRS specified in the `subset-crs` parameter value, or Gregorian UTC time if the `subset-crs` parameter is missing.
|===

NOTE: When the intervalOrPoint values fall partially outside of the range of valid values defined by the CRS for the identified axis, the service is expected to return the non-empty portion of the resource resulting from the subset.
