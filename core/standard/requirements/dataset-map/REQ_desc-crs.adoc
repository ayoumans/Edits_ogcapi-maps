^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/dataset-map/desc-crs*
^|A |The `crs` property in the landing page of a dataset SHALL contain URI or safe CURIEs for the list of CRSs supported by the dataset as a whole.
^|B |If the storage CRS is not http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84, a `storageCrs` property in the landing page of a dataset  SHALL be the URI or the safe CURIEs for the server storage CRS for the dataset as a whole.
^|C |If the dataset is available more efficiently (e.g. it is stored in the server in that CRS) using a particular CRS that is not http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84, a `storageCrs` property in the landing page of a dataset SHALL be the identifier for that CRS.
^|D |If a `storageCrs` property is used and that is not http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84, an extent SHALL be provided in a `storageCrsExtent` property following the same schema as the extent property.
|===

NOTE: A CURIE {authority}[-{objectType}]:{id} would map to the following OGC URI: http://www.opengis.net/def/{objectType}/{authority}/0/{id}. If -{objectType} is missing, the default object type is crs.
