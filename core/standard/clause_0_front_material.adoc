[big]*i.     Abstract*

The _OGC API - Maps - Part 1: Core_ Standard defines a Web API for requesting maps over the Web.
A _map_ is portrayal of geographic information as a digital representation suitable for display on a rendering device
(adapted from http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=14416[OGC 06-042/ISO 19128 OpenGIS® Web Map Server (WMS) Implementation Specification]).
Implementations of the _OGC API - Maps_ Standard are designed for a client to easily:

* Request a visual representation of one or more geospatial data layers in different styles;
* Select by area, time and resolution of interest;
* Change parameters such as the background color and coordinate reference systems.

A server that implements _OGC API - Maps_ provides information about what maps are offered.
_OGC API - Maps_ addresses use cases similar to those addressed by the http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=14416[OGC 06-042/ISO 19128 OpenGIS® Web Map Server (WMS) Implementation Specification] Standard.

[big]*iv.    Security considerations*
The OGC API — Maps — Part 1 only defines HTTP GET operations so the security considerations are limited to the ones applicable to a "read only" service. However, the implementations of OGC API - Maps has to process resource paths and query parameters in a way that they cannot be used by a client to inject malicious queries that makes available unforeseen data or even force the server to perform unwanted or dangerous actions. The following paragraphs enumerate some security considerations.

Due to the flexibility in generating maps, implementations that have not be optimized can easily encounter requests that take some time to resolve. If several of these requests are processed simultaneously, the server can become slow or unresponsive. Servers should take advantage of space partitioning structures that guarantee a deterministic maximum amount of data to process, such as the 2D Tile Matrix Set data structure (used in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF, OGC API - Tiles, GeoPackage, etc.), applying cartographic generalization for regions covering a larger area. Servers should also set and apply reasonable limits (e.g. maximum width, etc.) to prevent such situations potentially allowing Denial of Service attacks.

Some OGC API - Maps deployments may assign different roles to different users that may result in accessing different collections or geographical areas that can be represented as maps. The access control can be described in the OpenAPI definition as discussed in OGC API - Common (https://docs.ogc.org/is/19-072/19-072.html#rc_oas30-security). Servers should take care that all resources in all representations and ways they can be requested (e.g. adding query parameters) are managed consistently.

HTTPS queries are preferred to HTTP. The obvious reason is the responded map should be only accessible to the requesting user. Another reason is related with the public accessibility of the request itself. They reveal geographical extents that might be associated with private or sensible information. 
For instance users commonly visit "home" or "work" or "target places" (e.g holidays or churches). These requests can be used to extract personal or private activities.
