== Requirements Class "OpenAPI Specification 3.0" API definition

=== Overview

include::requirements/requirements_class_oas30.adoc[]

The OpenAPI requirements class defines the specifics of providing a definition of a Web API implementing the Maps API Standard using OpenAPI Specification version 3.0.

=== Web API OpenAPI description

The OpenAPI definition provides a description of the complete list of API resources. Reading this description, an application would have the full picture of the resources that the API provides, how to retrieve resources, and what responses are expected for successful and unsuccessful requests. Without an API description or documentation an application would be forced to traverse all links, starting with the landing page, to get an equivalent full list of resources.

The (_oas30_) requirement class from _OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core_ provides many details on general requirements that this requirements class adopts by dependency. In addition, extra requirements are provided here. Also, the _OGC API - Common_ requirements class provides details on how to request an API definition.

==== Response

===== Completeness
The OpenAPI definition resulting as a response to this request need to take into consideration the relevant resources specified in the Maps API standard.

include::requirements/oas30/REQ_completeness.adoc[]

===== Reusable API components

Reusable components for creating OpenAPI definitions for implementations of this OGC API can be found in http://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/maps/part1/1.0/openapi

NOTE: While this specification is in draft status, the components are available from https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-maps/tree/master/openapi .

A server implementation of the OGC API â€“ Maps Standard can use the content in the openapi folder to generate a response for the openapi description. The _ogcapi-maps-1.yaml_ includes paths and components. An implementation should only include the paths that are implemented and remove the references to the paths that are not implemented. The components part includes parameters, responses and schemas that can be reused as-is. The `api` folder contains JSON files that are templates with enumerated values for collections, styles and tile matrix sets. A particular implementation of the Maps API should enumerate the actual resources exposed by the API deployment in the same way. The server can select to dynamically implement responses to /api/* (where * is replaced by all-collections, styles,... ) or hardcode the /api/* files with the actual list of resource identifiers in the enumerations.

To improve performance, the whole content of this folder can be bundled into a single document by executing a tool such as _swagger-cli_. This document can be served for the _OGC API - Common - Part 1_ `service-desc` link from the landing page.

===== Path Operation Ids

The OpenAPI definition provides to a client application a set of paths that the client can use to interact with the API and get new resources. The OpenAPI description of each path provides a description of what parameters to use in the request and what to expect in the response. 
However, , the Maps API Standard does not propose a fixed set of paths so there is an issue identifying the requirements classes pertaining to each path in an API instance. In other words, the OpenAPI description alone does not provide enough information by itself. Therefore, there is a need to associate the resource paths in the API definition with the resources defined in the various requirements classes.
The Maps APIs Standard proposes a suffix mechanism to be applied to the `operationId` property of the path to list the requirement classes pertaining to each path. Each path should have a unique operationId suffix, so it is expected that the OpenAPI instance provides a prefix to the proposed suffixes that make each operationId unique.
